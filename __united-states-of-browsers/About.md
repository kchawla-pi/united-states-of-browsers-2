# About me and this project
This is not technical stuff, unecessary to read to use the project. These are   my soliloquies. 
### What is United States of Browsers (USB) 
A project to combine history and bookmarks across multiple browsers and browser profiles and allow more powerful search than browsers usually allow.

### Why do I program
I love programing. I want to be BRILLIANT at it. The kind that, when another developer learns they will be collaborating with me, or working on code base written by me, all concerns about half-baked, undocumented, untested, messy code goes out the window. They feel happy and excited to read my code.

### Why did I build it
This project is my vehicle to learn more and better programming. It's also a very useful tool for me, and hopefully, others.

### What all have I learnt so far
Thanks to this project, I have 
 - improved my python significantly in a short while, learning and utilizing many features of the langugae that I may not have learnt otherwise.
 - Learnt to write tests and use Pytest.
 - I have become proficient at using Git
 - Basic HTML and CSS
 - SQL queries. 
 - Realized good UI design skills are super important and require lots of quality learning efforts. 
 
 ### What am I working on right now
 Currently I am learning the entire software life-cycle. Continuos Integration and deployment, aka CI/CD.
 Also looking at ways to package the app as a single executable, maybe use Pex and Bazel.
 
 ### What more am I hoping to learn
 In the not too distant future, I will add: 
 - Web-scraping and search for the urls in the database. I have learnt Scrapy. 
 - Machine learning to the mix, for words categorization, tag sugestion, better search.

### What gave me the idea
The idea sprouted as I use multiple browsers and multiple browser profiles. This scatters my history, bookmarks across multiple interfaces. 

Whenever I wish to search something, I have to go through them all until I find them. I wish to build a tool which will read browser profile files and combine the history and bookmarks list, ready to be searched and organized automatically.

### Why I use multiple browsers
I like playing with technology and tech produts and wana check out different browsers and see where they are at.

### Why I use multiple browser profiles
They used to help me compartmentalize tasks better and to maintain focus. The habit is now mine.

### But seriously, why do yo-
There's no answer to these questions
